A new option has been added in the main menu of this core called: "Serial SNAC DB9MD" to activate 1 or 2 players for the
DB9 Mega Drive / genesis controllers. This feature is disabled by default, therefore you must enter the menu for the 
first time to activate it and save.

For total control from the Mega drive / Genesis controllers (also the OSD menu) it is necessary to update the files 
MiSTer and menu.rbf from the root of the SD card. You can get an updated version of this files here: 

https://github.com/antoniovillena/MiSTer_DB9/tree/master/_Splitter_DB9MD

Menu buttons: 

Start + C-> Show OSD menu
	A-> Enter
	B-> Esc
